# Resolution Changer

![App Screenshot](resources/res_changer_screen.png)

Simple app to change your resolution.

Also saves the resolutions so that apps such as CS2 won't switch the resolution back to the previous one after alt-tabing.

This app shows all available resolutions with the highest available refresh rate.
